# Lambek-Grishin-Parsing
A bottom-up parser for the Lambek-Grishin calculus, written in Prolog. It was the main subject of my bachelor thesis, under supervision of prof. dr. Michael Moortgat.

A description of the code can be found in chapter 4. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a linguistic background to typelogical grammars and parsing. Chapter 3 describes the abstract procedure, based on the Parsing Schemata of Sikkel.
